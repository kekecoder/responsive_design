        <h2>Low and Low</h2>
        <h4>posted by <strong>BGB</strong>, <time>November 15, 2016</time></h4>
        <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking
            technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i>
            cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a
            water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the
            food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
            Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
            <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill
                    Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
                <time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>
                <p>Location: <em>Baker&quot;s Corner, Sekonk, Ma</em><br>
                Hours: <em><time>Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm</time></em>
