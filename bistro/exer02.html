        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p>This week i am extremely excited about a new cooking techniqu called <strong>Sous Vide.</strong>In <em>sous vide</em>cooking, you submerge thr food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <q>Cooking For Geek</q>, <strong>Jeff Potter</strong> describes it as ulta-low-temperature poaching.</p>
        <p>
            Next month, we will be serving <em>Sous Vide Salmon</em> with <strong><i>DIll Hollandais.</i></strong>To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time>November 30.</time>

        <p>Warning: <strong>Sous Vide</strong>cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p>
